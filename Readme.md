# Running App

This project is an application for runners that will record the distance and duration of miles ran to track their progress.
The runner will need to input the miles and length of time to get reports. The features inluded in this application will have:
* A list with several values with at least one value retrieved
* Read data from a JSON file that deserializes to list
* A log that records errors back into JSON file.
